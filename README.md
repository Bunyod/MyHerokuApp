###24/7 Customer Service
  Rest easy knowing real people are ready to help you 24 hours a day. Everyone on our award-winning Customer Care team is an experienced Squarespace user.
  * The restaurant estimates your delivery time based on the number of drivers they have and the delivery territories they set up in our system. Keep in mind, there could be delays due to heavy traffic, bad weather, hamster parades, Hoverboard sightings, or an alien invasion. Excluding unforeseeable conditions like these, we promise your food will arrive as soon as possible.
  * After logging into your EAT24 account, click on the "Past Orders" tab. You can then view all your previous orders and final receipts. Any changes that were made to your order will be reflected here.
  * You'll need to order from a restaurant that accepts CashCoupons, (there's over 20,000 of them nationwide) and pay with a credit card. You have to be an EAT24 member and can only use the coupon once. The coupon can only be applied on orders over $10 and the coupon value will be applied when you complete the order.
  * If you ever need to make a change to your order, just tell us and we'll take care of it. You can reach us anytime by live chat, email, or phone - 24 hours a day, every day. If needed, we will personally contact the restaurant and make sure that all changes are made to your order. Please note that if you cancel an order, the restaurant might charge you 30% of your order total to cover costs - but we'll fully reimburse you for this charge, no questions asked.
